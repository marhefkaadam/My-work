# School projects in C++

During my studies, I created many programs in C++ and C. However, most of them are school assignments that have either complicated or, on the contrary, uninteresting assignment. That's why I chose only 2 projects in C++. One of them is a semestral work and the other one is an assignment during the semester. Both assignments were given in the subject Programming and Algorithmization 2. 

We learned to program in the C language, basic abstract data structures, the basics of algorithmic reasoning and how to write readable code in the subject Programming and Algorithmization 1. In Programming and Algorithmization 2 we continued to learn this in the C++ language. I also programmed in C++ in the subject Operating systems, where we tried working with threads in C++, and in the subject Algorithms and graphs, we programmed various more complex algorithmic tasks (e.g. BFS, Binary trees, etc.).
